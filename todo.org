* Minimal example
  simple nrn script with ghk Ca mechanism
  - [X] remove Ca diffusion and replace with simple exp decay
  - [?] test neuron's ghk routine instead of doing everything from scratch
         apparently ghk can't be used from nmodl, full implementation thus kept
  - [X] check eqs: neuron == wikipedia == hille

* lems
  - [ ] test existing ghk (hardcoded for Ca)
  - [ ] generalize to any ion
