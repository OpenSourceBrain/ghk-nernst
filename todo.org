* DONE Minimal example
simple nrn script with ghk Ca mechanism
nrn/ghk_na_k_ca.py
- [X] remove Ca diffusion and replace with simple exp decay
- [?] test neuron's ghk routine instead of doing everything from scratch
       apparently ghk can't be used from nmodl, full implementation thus kept
- [X] check eqs: neuron == wikipedia == hille
- 

* TODO lems
lems/ghk_na_k_ca.xml
- [X] test existing ghk (hardcoded for Ca). Issue, see discussions below
- [ ] test existing nernst (hardcoded for Ca). 
- [ ] generalize both to any ion
       will probably require changes to lems -- discussed with Robert and
       Padraig but no consensus yet
  
** DONE discuss
- initialization issues if CaConc dynamics is not defined in terms
of conditional variables ([Ca++]i(0) is NaN and the interpreter
stops when calculating the dynamics). Circumventend by imposing
condition Ca > 0 ? x : 0


* TODO nC
- [X] project with nrn/channelml channels
- [ ] write doc for using Nernst/GHK from nC (setting pars)
