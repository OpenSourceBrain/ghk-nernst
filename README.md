ghk-nernst
==========

Sample lems files implementing a single compartment model, containg HH
type Na+/K+ channels, a Ca++ channel and pool. The Calcium current
through the channel can be calculated either through the
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHK_flux_equation]GHK flux equation],
or using Ohm's law +
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nernst_equation]Nernst Equation] to
approximate its reversal potential.

The same mechanisms are implemented in NEURON as a comparison.
